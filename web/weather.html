		<p>Have you ever heard the weather had(has) some sort of order?
		I have.</p>
		<p>
		For example, it was normal in early hours of a day, clouds came and rained until sunrise.
		With that came new day and fresh air which you could chew in your mouth.
		It was normal when it's very muggy especially in the afternoon, after a few moments clouds came with thunderstorm and rain.
		After 2 hours thunderstorm and rain were gone☀️ and every plant🌳 had enough water to survive to a next rain shower.
		Yes, this was normal beheavior of the weather in middle of Europe described from 60's to late 80's in the last century.
		I can't tell from anywhere else.
		</p>
		<p>

		But not anymore, nowadays clouds come and nothing happens.
		Mainly in the winter it is more like 50 shades of grey for weeks and months, this also happens in other seasons too. By that I mean <b>no</b> snow❄️ or rain💧.
		Then usually comes spring with completely clear sky at night and freezing temperatures usually below zero degrees of celsius.
		That damages the crop. It's so funny when all day is cloudy and then just before sunset <b>all clouds are gone</b>(That happens all seasons too).
		Next morning after breakfast clouds come and rain. That means lower temperatures during a day and even lower at night.
		It didn't happen once, but enough times to notice it on the damaged crop.
		</p>

		<p>
		Summer is then like switcher. You get poor summer with lower temperatures, lot of rain <b>or</b> very high temperatures with no rain.
		When rain comes it then takes usually 2 days when all those clouds got clear away. In olden days clouds and rain and then clouds and rain are gone.
		Nowadays it is clouds and rain and then clouds and nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sky is also more often covered by thin clouds from air traffic. It's like living in black and white movie.
		Especially in 🌡️hot and dry 2022 August I noticed it. Maybe this is onto <a href="http://www.nuclearplanet.com/apmh.pdf">something</a>.
		When it's got too dry not only the crop is getting weak, but when rain comes the ground is in such bad condition so it doesn't suck any water. So eventually the water ends somewhere else.
		</p>

		<p>

		If weather go back to normal, there will be no need for hideous water tank system in the garden, powerful drainage systems, dam around cities and so on.
		Everything will be with helpful hand from the weather. Nevertheless we are pushed to do more and more things to cope with it.
